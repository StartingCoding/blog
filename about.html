<p style="width: 60%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">I’m really passionate about tech, in 2018 I started learning programming just for fun and in 2019 I started to take it seriously. I started to learn Swift developing mobile apps following courses on <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/" target="_blank">HackingWithSwift</a> made by Paul Hudson. Lately I’m focusing on building my own projects trying to solve real world problems.</p>
