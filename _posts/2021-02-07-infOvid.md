# TL;DR

This is an app that lets you stay up to date with the daily numbers of Covid cases in Italy.


I’ve built the design using SwiftUI and I used Combine to make declarative the work of the asynchronous network events (URLSession) so it can retrieve the data from the REST API made by GitHub directly from the official Italian GitHub repository.

The full project can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/StartingCoding/infOvid-portfolio" target="_blank">https://github.com/StartingCoding/infOvid-portfolio</a>.

## Why I built this app

This project started when I was starting to see the first big wave of the pandemic happening. I saw people splitting up into two major blocks: one that was monitoring the number of Covid cases watching the map of the website of the John Hopkins, and other people didn’t know how or when to discover this data.

When I found out that there weren't any good mobile resources to see this important data, I built this app trying to solve my first real-world problem.

The thing I was doing at the time was watching the map from my MacBook but when I tried to use it on the go, it wasn’t great so I thought why not create an app for it.

At the time the only knowledge I had was just a tiny bit of SwiftUI. That’s it. But seeing for the first that I could solve a real-world problem instead of following just tutorials was motivating, so maybe even if it was too big for being the first real project I said Let’s do it! Let’s create a mobile iOS app that can show the numbers of Covid.

## How I built it

I decided to build it with SwiftUI just to see how this new framework could be in the real world.

At first, the design was fairly simple to do but then it got complicated to build. So when I found out that there were ways to organize your code called Design Pattern I choose to learn MVVM.

Design patterns are like when you try to organize your file (documents, photos, videos…) in a clear specific directory so when you search for a specific thing you are more likely to found it.

MVVM stands for Model - View - ViewModel

With this approach you have:
- Views: just the design, what it should look
- Model: just the structure of the data you want to use in your project
- ViewModel: the bridge between Views and Model, can give data to a View from a Model so it can have context and show something useful instead of placeholder, and can change data based on the Model when the user interacts with the View

That took me quite a while because there wasn’t any official Italian REST API to call so that I cam have the data I needed. Fortunately, GitHub provides their API for every repository they have so I used that instead.

SwiftUI is a declarative framework and when I tried to use URLSession it worked, but it was feeling a little imperative (when this happens, go do this and if this happens, go do that) so I tried to use Combine.

Combine is a framework that makes you handle asynchronous events (URLSession) but in a declarative way.

Making it declarative instead of the imperative is like going to YouTube and subscribe to a channel so you can see every new video automatically instead of going to YouTube and searching every time for the last published video of a channel.

That’s all the technology I used for building infOvid.

I tried to upload it to the App Store but the guidelines for upload a Covid app are pretty strict, so now it lives only on my GitHub.
